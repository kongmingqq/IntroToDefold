# First Defold project

I was following a tutorial for Unity but found the engine was too bloated and slow
for my use case. After comparing a few engines I liked Defold the most and decided
to "remake" the tutorial game in it.

Assets are from:
- [The original Unity Tutorial](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Unity-Game-Development---Build-6-Games-with-Unity-2023.git)
- [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/)
- [britzl's public examples](https://github.com/britzl/publicexamples.git)
